⭐ Centralized Reward System
📜 Project Description

Centralized Reward System is a blockchain-powered platform built on the Aptos Move framework that consolidates rewards from multiple apps (e-commerce, travel, food delivery, etc.) into a single unified wallet. This system allows users to combine smaller, scattered rewards into one spendable balance, enabling them to make large, high-value purchases without wasting reward points.
